#Responisve design using mostly bootstrap#
##########################################

My introduction to boot strap I did my best to rely on the built in styles rather than the self made 
css. Through doing so i learned how to: 
    *build responsive columns and rows 
    *select different frame column widths depending on screen size:sm md lg 
    *float an image inside a column and make text wrap around the same column   
        in that cloumn found i needed to include 
I made a responsive nav bar that turns into a dropdown at md screen width
 
I added a footer that is fixed to the bottom of the page as the user scrolls up and down.

On the portfolio page instead of using multiple rows I felt in order to get the result i wanted it was best to use 
one row with three screen settings. (col-sm-12) makes the column full width (col-md-6) makes the clumn half width creating two columns (col-lg-3) makes the column 1/4 width creating four columns.

for the form page i made a basic form that expands large to small depending on the screen.
